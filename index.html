        <h2>About Tokyo</h2>

        <p class="p p1">
            Tokyo (東京, Tōkyō) is Japan's capital and the world's most populous metropolis.
         It is also one of Japan's 47 prefectures, consisting of 23 central city wards and multiple cities,
          towns and villages west of the city center. The Izu and Ogasawara Islands are also part of Tokyo.
          Prior to 1868, Tokyo was known as Edo. A small castle town in the 16th century,
           Edo became Japan's political center in 1603 when Tokugawa Ieyasu established his feudal government there.
            A few decades later, Edo had grown into one of the world's most populous cities. With the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the emperor and capital moved from Kyoto to Edo, which was renamed Tokyo ("Eastern Capital").
             Large parts of Tokyo were destroyed in the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 and in the air raids of 1945.</p>

       <h2 id="history">History of Tokyo</h2>
            
        <p class="p p3">
                Tokyo was originally a small fishing village, Edo, in what was formerly part of the old Musashi Province. Edo was first
                fortified by the Edo clan, in the late twelfth century. In 1457, Ōta built Edo Castle.
                In 1590, Ieyasu moved from Mikawa Province (his lifelong base) to the Kantō region. When he became shōgun in 1603,
                Edo became the center of his ruling. During the subsequent Edo period, Edo grew into one of the largest cities in
                the world During the Edo era, the city enjoyed a prolonged period of peace known as the Pax Tokugawa, and in the presence of such
                peace, Edo adopted a stringent policy of seclusion, helped to perpetuate lack of threat to the city.
                The absence of war-inflicted devastation allowed Edo to devote the majority of its resources to rebuilding in
                the wake of the consistent fires, earthquakes, other devastating disasters that plagued the city.
